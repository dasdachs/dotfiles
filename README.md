# Configurations

I am never satisfied with the way my terminal, vim, code editor, linter etc. are configured.
This repo contains my configurations with coments. Hope you will find them useful.

*Bash*:
Pretty standard Ubuntu configurations. I really like it that way.

*Vim*:
- support for `JavaScript`, `node`, `Python`, `c`, `c++`, `css` (indentation, syntax)
- supprt for markup:`html`,  `markdown`, `resTructured text` (indentation, syntax)
- `Python` autocompletion and linting
- `Javascript` and `node.js` linting
- `NerdTree` included

## Install

Clone the repo into your home directory and open `vim`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dasdachs/work-configurations .
vim
```

Run `vim`:

```vim
:PluginInstall
```

Your `vim` plugins are in you `.vim` directory.

That is it :)
